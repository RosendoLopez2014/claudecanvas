# Build Plans (Historical)

This directory contains implementation plans from the initial build sessions (Feb 12–16, 2026). They are historical artifacts documenting the design decisions and task breakdowns used during development.

These plans were executed in order and each reflects the state of the codebase at the time. They are **not living documents** — for current architecture and patterns, see:

- [Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Development Guide](../DEVELOPMENT.md)
- [Security](../SECURITY.md)
- [IPC Reference](../IPC-REFERENCE.md)
